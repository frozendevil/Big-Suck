#  BIG SUCK

An app inspired by https://hachyderm.io/@samhenrigold/112378640102423012

TODO:
- Make it a `LSUIElement` so it doesn't have a dock icon
- Before it doesn't have a dock icon it should probably not have so many obvious bugs
- Support multiple monitor configurations
- Actually delete the file dropped on it (or at least move it to /tmp or the trash)

Disclaimer:
If the above TODOs didn't make it clear, This project is a hack. There is a significant amount of work left to make it ~useful~ reliable and production-ready. There are many bugs, the code is not well factored, and I've only tried running it on a single computer—which is a laptop with a built-in display. I don't have any active plans to actually do any of the TODOs. Contributions are welcome but I don't guarantee responding to them in a reasonable amount of time.
